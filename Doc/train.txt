You mainly interact with the train part through 3 scripts:
	train.m  which will train the net using MNIST dataset and do a correct rate sampling
	NetExtractor.m which will extract the net configure into a file under the output dirtory
	DataExtractor.m which will extract single/multi frames from the MNIST dataset as a file, also under output directory

The APIs composing these scripts(which are defined under Functions directory)

	loadMNISTImages/loadMNISTLabels: automatically extrace the binary files from the MNIST database

	initialNet: initialize the link values

	mlpff: feed-forward calculation

	mlpbp: back-propragation

	applyGrads: use the gradient to adjust the link weights
